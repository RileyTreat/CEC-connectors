Although our organization is relatively new to clean energy TA and RCAP has not directly worked with communities in an EECBG application capacity, RCAP's regional network holds on-the-ground relationships with thousands of rural communities, many of which are EECBG-eligible, and has extensive experience helping small communities leverage funding. In FY2023 alone, the RCAP network's assistance on application processes helped communities gain over $440 million in infrastructure funding. This assistance includes support at every phase of the application process, from funding identification, understanding requirements, pre-planning and pre-development to drafting funding applications, packaging required materials, and submitting applications. Post award, RCAP's network of regional partners frequently supports community engagement and project development, design, delivery, and sustainable management.",
            "publicTaExperience_12": "As noted above, TA provided by the RCAP network helped rural and Tribal communities leverage over $440 million in FY23 alone. During that year, RCAP TA benefitted more than 3.1 rural residents living in over 2,100 small communities nationwide. RCAP has operated federal TA programs for decades, including under EPA's National Priority Areas for public water systems, wastewater systems, and private well owners and under annual grants with USDA's TAT program for water/wastewater systems, utilities in Colonias and Tribal areas, and solid waste systems. Since 2023, RCAP has been a national EPA Environmental Finance Center supporting disadvantaged communities; through Q5 of this five-year program, RCAP partners had already helped communities submit 21 infrastructure funding applications, leveraging over $17 million in successful awards. RCAP and five of its regions currently provide TA and capacity building to sixteen communities in the USDOT Thriving Communities Program, with a focus on helping them advance locally-identified transportation and economic development goals. In 2019, RCAP was one of four organizations selected by the USDA Rural Development Innovation Center to co-design and launch the REDI Initiative with 47 rural communities to support regional planning to overcome multi-jurisdictional challenges and to help better leverage federal, state, local, and private funding. Under this, RCAP worked with 30 communities in 21 states to develop and implement economic development plans and unlock more than $4.9 million in funding.",
            "inPersonExperience_13": "RCAP's national office has a training department with four staff members and a program management department with six staff members. These individuals have a depth of collective experience with facilitation, outreach and engagement, and delivery of both in-person and virtual trainings. RCAP supports its regional partners with their annual training goals and it designs and delivers in-person many train-the-trainer events, typically at least 3-5 per year. Some examples of recent and upcoming RCAP train-the-trainer topics include climate resilience, environmental finance, lead service line replacement, solid waste management, and disaster response/recovery. RCAP conducts a larger annual National Training Conference for its network partners; this three-day event usually draws up to 300 attendees and offers a diverse variety of training tracks. Through funded EPA and private programs, RCAP is also currently engaged in the creation and delivery of workforce development training for administrative professionals at utilities and leadership development training for water utility personnel, including leadership courses that are being tailored to Spanish-speaking and Tribal audiences this year. RCAP can, and often does, manage all aspects of in-person training processes including creation of curricula/content, managing event logistics and venue arrangements, coordinating with speakers and partners, promoting the event, delivering the training, and administering surveys and follow-up resources to attendees.",
            "virtualExperience_14": "Beyond in-person training, RCAP frequently creates and delivers virtual trainings through mediums including workshops, eLearnings, asynchronous online learnings, and webinars. Examples of its recently delivered virtual training topics are Tribal Financing Options, Regionalization/Regional Utility Partnerships, Small System Capacity Development, and Procurement and Purchasing Policies. RCAP typically makes its virtual offerings available to the public via a virtual webinar archive, learning management system catalogues, YouTube, e-newsletters, and partner websites. RCAP maintains an online library for training tools, guidebooks, and resources that are publicly available on its website—these resources are continually updated and added to. Among the resources on RCAP's Managerial and Financial Hub are several tools to help small water utilities with energy management, efficiency, and conservation practices. RCAP has managed all aspects of the delivery of virtual trainings and tools, including creating training content (both written and video), working with appropriate video/design vendors, delivering the training content, hosting live webinar platforms/spaces, and maintaining online archives for content.",
            "underservedExperience_15": "In FY2023 the average Median Household Income (MHI) among RCAP communities served was only $41,207 and RCAP TA efforts served communities in nearly half of all U.S. Persistent Poverty Counties. Among the 3.1 million total individuals benefiting from RCAP services in FY2023, over 1 million were persons of color and 156,000+ were Tribal members. RCAP's programs typically prioritize engagement with communities that are un-/under-served, including locations indicated as Disadvantaged on the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, IRA Energy Communities, Tribes, and U.S. territories (including the 2 Caribbean territories, 3 Pacific territories, and 3 freely associated states of Palau, Micronesia, and Marshall Islands), in addition to other factors, particularly considering these are all agency priorities for USDA Rural Development. TA providers in the RCAP network, in addition to coordinating closely with state officials to gain project/community referrals, often consider these tools and factors when prioritizing communities for TA service.",

One of the new projects that we are hoping to begin work on soon involves two communities in Appalachian Ohio in which we will be partnering with another organization to conduct training on solar panel installation for interested local residents. We then intend to contract on a design/build project to install solar panels at community facilities, with the understanding that all of the trainees will be able to work with and shadow the contractors to gain experience. Thus, it will represent not only an energy savings for the community, but an opportunity for workforce development in two severely disadvantaged communities. Other than those programs already mentioned, this work is relatively new to us.",
            "publicTaExperience_12": "We have over 45 years of experience in working with local governments in small communities to provide technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure (primarily water, wastewater and solid waste), economic development, and community facilities. On an annual basis in the seven states that we serve, we work with approximately 200 communities and help them mobilize over $100 million for infrastructure facilities annually. We assist communities with everything from developing financing packages, hiring technical consultants, community engagement, facility audits and operational improvements, financial operations such as budgeting, rate studies, etc. On the economic development side, we work with communities to form collaborative teams that represent diverse sectors of the community and help them build stronger entrepreneurial ecosystems. These efforts have helped to create more than 100 jobs in small communities over the last 5 years. We also operate a collaborative GIS program that collects and hosts data on water, wastewater and in some cases municipal electric systems for small communities that cannot afford their own staff and we train their utility personnel how to maximize the benefits of that. We currently have approximately 100 community members in this collaborative effort.",
            "inPersonExperience_13": "We regularly conduct trainings in virtually every grant program that we operate, and thus have extensive experience. At least 8 members of our staff have received training certifications through Langevin professional training organization. We regularly work with state regulators and funders to ensure that our training meets the needs of communities, and conduct evaluations of every training to work toward continuous improvement. Our staff does the complete training event that includes securing the venue and all related needs such as AV, food, etc. We develop our curricula and have staff that deliver the trainings. On the infrastructure side, our trainings are both technical that are primarily geared toward operators, and managerial and financial that are geared toward boards, town clerks and other staff. On an annual basis, we train hundreds of people, and our trainings are well regarded by both attendees and by regulators and funders. On the economic development side, we provide trainings on strategies that work well for small communities, developing entrepreneurial ecosystems, leadership development and more. We have staff that are certified trainers in the Entrepreneurial Mindset, and are certified as coaches in the WealthWorks model and administrators of economic gardening programs. Two of our staff have conducted training internationally in several countries at the request of the U.S. Department of State. For several years, we held an annual multi-day conference in Ohio dubbed Small Towns, Big Futures that saw approximately 300 attendees per event. A list of all of our current training topics can be provided upon request.",
            "virtualExperience_14": "We have been providing virtual trainings since 2015, and that was ramped up significantly during the pandemic. We have an LMS system and offer virtual trainings on a regular basis. We also offer hybrid trainings for many of our in-person trainings for those that cannot attend in person. Our topics are much the same as our in-person trainings (though modified for the format), and as with our in-person trainings, we do the entire organization of the events in-house.",
            "underservedExperience_15": "Since 1980, GLCAP has served as a regional affiliate organization of the Rural Community Assistance Partnership (RCAP). Virtually every community we work in is a small, disadvantaged and underserved community. Two of the states that we serve are entirely within Appalachia (Kentucky and West Virginia), as is the southern third of Ohio. Many of the areas in these states have been identified as persistent poverty counties, meaning that the area has experienced a poverty rate above 20% for at least the last 30 years. In addition, GLCAP is part of the Community Action network created during President Johnson's war on poverty as mentioned above, and as such, every program that we operate is targeted to reducing poverty for low-income individuals, families and communities. As previously mentioned, we work with hundreds of communities annually and regularly assist them with mobilizing funds to solve their problems.",
            "underservedPlan_16": "Due to the fact that we have 45 years of experience in working with these communities already, we have longstanding relationships with many of them, and are usually the first to receive a call when a community has a problem they need to solve. We expect that we can easily leverage those existing relationships. Building trust in these communities is both essential and time-consuming, and we have the advantage of having already done that difficult work.",
            "federalGrantExperience_17": "Our organization successfully manages over 150 federal and state grants annually. We have significant fiscal policies and procedures in place and are subject to the federal government's required single audit process, with no audit findings over the past 20 years. We also work with numerous local governments to administer grants on their behalf such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), loan funds and more.",
            "collaborationExperience_18": "Yes, we regularly collaborate with other partners and organizations. As previously noted, we are part of the national RCAP network in which 6 separate regional organizations partner with the national RCAP office. Locally, we partner with a number of organizations, particularly smaller nonprofits that do not have the capacity or expertise to manage federal funds. Local examples include operating the Sandusky River Watershed Coalition on behalf of a number of partners and operation the Great Lakes Consortium for International Training and Development, which includes a number of university and community partners.",
            "uniqueResorces_19": "One of the most unique capabilities that we bring to the table is having boots on the ground in underserved areas across the country, and having the existing relationships of trust with communities that is invaluable.",
            "workplanDeliverables_20": "We have ideas of several things that could be explored, including but not limited to the following: 1) workforce training for solar panel installation 2) installation of solar panels at various community facilities and offices 3) conduct energy and operational audits of energy usage at water and wastewater facilities since energy costs are approximately 40% of a small utility's budget 4) conduct studies of local electric aggregation options with a focus on options that prioritize the purchase of green power 5) development of community engagement plans 6) TA to assist in building the necessary coalitions for developing green energy projects.",
            "milestoneTimelines_21": "During the first six months of the project we would be working to identify communities and assess community needs and priorities, as well as developing and conducting community engagement strategies.

While direct involvement with EECBG formula applicants has been limited, SAU has engaged in projects aligning with EECBG objectives, such as the development of the LiTHIUMLEARNS initiative to support the lithium industry in Southwest Arkansas. Southern Arkansas University (SAU), a predominantly undergraduate, four-year institution, finds itself at the epicenter of the next energy revolution: lithium. What was once considered a remote rural area has now become globally significant due to the discovery of a vast lithium resource, attracting major players in the lithium industry such as ExxonMobil, Tetra Technologies, and Standard Lithium. One significant challenge remains: supporting the lithium boom and tech-based startups requires a skilled and educated workforce. Workforce development for Lithium extraction and processing is of great interest to SAU for partnerships. SAU aims to prepare Arkansans to lead the U.S. lithium market and encourage corporations to continue investing in the state by producing a homegrown, skilled STEM-based workforce. Please read the following article by Arkansas Times on the recent $2.75M grant to SAU last month to support Lithium energy efforts: https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2024/12/31/southern-arkansas-university-receives-2-75-million-grant-for-lithium-workforce-training.",

These roads are vital community transportation lifelines. NbS offer adaptive management strategies, crucial in the proposed setting where traditional engineering approaches have failed. HDOT is supportive of NbS, but lacks understanding of community-receptive NbS. Essential Leap worked with HDOT, PICHTR, University of Hawaii, and local schools and nonprofits to conceive a proposed project to engage communities from Laie to Kaaawa to identify additional resilience needs and determine receptivity to NbS that can protect coastal highways and natural environments. The output would be a community resilience report on coastal hazard vulnerabilities and community-supported NbS.

Topics include community sustainability strategies, water/wastewater system management, capital readiness training, and business management classes. As well, CU has a robust LMS system to provide trainings online. Working with our Communications Team to promote the events, training forums are organized and promoted by the applicable leadership team.",
            "virtualExperience_14": "Because we are spread throughout a 7-state region, CU relies heavily on TEAMS, ZOOM, and web-based training (LMS) for many of its training, workshops, and networking opportunities. Example: TA provides virtual trainings multiple times a quarter. Interested persons can register online, attend from anywhere with viable internet, and, as the presenter is live, the attendee is able to ask questions and engage in conversations with other attendees. The topic depends on what CU area is presenting. It could be a grant writing class, trainings on viable water systems, a GIS presentation to discuss a road project, a capital readiness course for borrowers, or perhaps a training on community leadership strategies for rural city council members.",

We have been serving these communities since the 70's and have roots that run deep in the rural space that we service. Our environmental and CS area have done extensive work with native tribes in Oklahoma to ensure access to clean drinking water, to work with those and other rural communities on growth and leadership strategies, to implement good financial tracking systems, receive training in grant writing, etc. We have funded multiple renovations to local, rural water systems and public buildings located in communities throughout our 7 states. The lending area and TA teams have worked with a multitude of small business owners to provide both funding and small business training opportunities. I have experience with wind energy projects in rural Oklahoma, new market tax credit training, have been active with SPP, and have been heavily engrained in public/political education initiatives in the state. I would encourage you to go our website and see the metrics on our outreach at https://communitiesu.org/impact/. It gives some good details of the outstanding work we do here at CU.",

Because it is a food desert, our Healthy Foods director is working with them on strategies for access to fresh fruit and vegetables. We will continue that collaborative effort with this program as well. As mentioned above, our renewable energy team in comprised of leaders from each of our specialty areas, so that wealth of knowledge, community engagement skills, environmental and engineering training, and lending expertise will all be included in our outreach.

Example: Lending (with the help of our TA Team) did a large loan by partnering with 6 other organizations in the TX Panhandle. Working with community leaders, we were able to help facilitate the opening of a large production facility in the area. This provided higher than average paying salaries for its many employees and has been an economic boost for the local economy. As well, we host community events in partnership with other CDFI's, local government leaders, industry experts, etc. Our events are typically project specific and leave a community with perhaps a better managed water system, a completed community rate study, a design and/or grant for street improvements, a newly funded business with trained & qualified staffing, a new supply chain for fresh fruits and vegetables for the local school system, or better trained mayor, city manager, and council members ready to take on the challenges of climate change. By finding partners in our states, CU was able to in 2023 serve 1,061,128 people. CU lent $7,163,141.
